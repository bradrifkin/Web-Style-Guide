# Web Style Guide

This project was Project #4 as part of the Treehouse Front End Web Development Techdegree. The project utilizes Sass and displays a style guide in both a mobile and laptop/desktop screens. Flexbox was also implemented to assist in the layout of the components of the page. To improve style sheet readability, partials were used to organize base styles, components, and utilities.
